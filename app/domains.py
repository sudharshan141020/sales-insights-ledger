Phase 2 — Domain detection.

Takes the per-column semantic roles produced by semantic_roles.classify_columns()
and scores which domain the dataset most likely belongs to. This module knows
nothing about column names or dataframes directly — it only ever looks at the
ROLE labels Phase 1 already assigned, which is what keeps the two phases
cleanly separable (and testable independently, per the phased-build plan).

Adding a new domain later means adding one new entry to DOMAIN_SIGNALS —
nothing else in this file, or in semantic_roles.py, needs to change.

# domain -> {semantic_role: weight}
# IMPORTANT: only roles that are genuinely DISTINCTIVE of a domain belong
# here. CATEGORY, QUANTITY, and FINANCIAL_METRIC were deliberately left out
# after testing — they show up across nearly every domain (a healthcare
# file has "categories" too, a traffic file has "quantities" too), so
# including them let unrelated datasets accumulate enough incidental score
# to falsely claim a domain. A real test case caught this: Titanic scored
# as "sales" purely from 3 incidental CATEGORY columns + 2 QUANTITY columns,
# despite having zero PRODUCT, DISCOUNT, or CUSTOMER signal — the roles that
# actually mean something for "sales."
