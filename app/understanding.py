Dataset Understanding Engine.

This is the new foundation layer: instead of the rest of the app each
re-deriving "what's the metric, what's chartable" in their own way (which is
exactly the duplication the redesign brief calls out), everything downstream
— the analysis planner, visualization planner, insight engine, weak-point
detector — should consume ONE structured DatasetProfile produced here.

Builds directly on the existing semantic_roles.classify_columns() and
domains.detect_domain() — this phase does not throw that work away, it
gives it a proper home and a richer output shape (an entity name, a full
list of measures instead of just one, a full list of dimensions) instead of
the narrower "primary_metric_col" the old planner used.
